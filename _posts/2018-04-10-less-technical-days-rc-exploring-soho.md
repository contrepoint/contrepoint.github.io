Blogpost catchup time! (thank goodness for daily checkins on Zulip - I can use those to remind myself 'what did I do on X day')

Technically, I managed some K&R C in the morning, read up on some Javascript, and after lunch, managed a naive solution to a Leetcode problem.

Went for a 1.5+ hour walk in Soho, which was very relaxing. It was nice to see (again, after so many years) stores that I visited in other cities such as Boston and Seattle.

On Monday, I asked around for comfy over-ear headphone recs. People suggested various models and I got to try on some RCers headphones (thank you). Someone has a Kinesis split and another person has a Kinesis advantage. They kindly said that when they are not using their keyboards, I am free to do so.

Had a lot of fun walking around Soho and talking with Lydia about our shared non-programming interests. We also had dinner together - that was fun.

Not the code-productive day I was expecting, but that's okay.
