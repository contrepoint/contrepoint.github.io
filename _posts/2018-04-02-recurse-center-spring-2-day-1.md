## First day at Recurse Center!
Cannot believe I am finally [here!](recurse.com) - I've wanted to go since I heard an alum talk about it in March/April 2016.

According to one of the co-founders, the only reason we should be at RC is to get dramatically better as a programmer. That's what I want. I also want to meet programmers who are kind, talented, interested in many programming and non-programming topics, and unashamedly _nerdy_. Recursers are exactly those people. Some of the things people want to do here include write rootkits, learn computer science fundamentals, learn machine learning, program hardware, do math, contribute to open source, and most importantly, learn things only because they _want_ to.

Listing my goals at RC under the cut.

## Goals at RC
### 0. Get better at C by completing the K&R book
I already know some C from Harvard's CS50, but I want to learn the whole langaugae. It's the closest language to assembly, and will (re)teach me about pointers, memory, how things actually are on the hardware level, etc. I've learnt so much about servers and web connections since I was accepted to RC in Oct 2017 and so much of that code is in C. I want to learn what actually goes on 'underneath the abstractions'.

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms in Python and/or Ruby.
I want to teach myself the CS degree I don't have. The more I learn, the more I realise how important these fundamentals are, especially once one begins working at scale. And it's so lovely to see how graphs, sorting algorithms, linked lists, stacks, and queues are present in things I use every day, such as social media, my browser, audiovisual players, and so on.

### 2. Blog about the things I learn at RC
I keep procrastinating on actually writing a blog (it needs to be perfect, I don't have anything to say, etc) but many people here advice writing down what you did and learnt each day. Someone also recently advised me to compare myself to my past self, instead of comparing myself to other people. I shall try to do that.

### 3. Talk to and learn from other programmers, both in RC and outside RC.
Everyone has such different backgrounds, experiences, and stories. I want to hear from them and learn from them. I'd also like to think about fields I might like to explore and see whether I have any inclination towards them (security, hardware, etc).

### 4. Data visualisation (D3.js)
I really want to bring the joy and fun of What Programming Can Do to my friends because many of them do not program (and perhaps bring that joy to other people too?). D3.js allows me to easily display my work on the web for them to view, explore, and appreciate.

### 5. Write an SQL tutorial for non-programming folk
A lot of my friends do not need to program for a living but some programming skills would help their career (eg: biz analysts). As a fellow career-changer from a non-tech background, my motivation to learn how to program was to make my life easier at a non-tech job.

(I definitely want to do 0, 1, and 2. I hope I have time to at least start on the rest. And of course, when pairing with other people, I might discover more.)

## Finally...
I'll be here for the whole Spring 2 batch (Apr-Jun 2018).

Let the adventures begin!
